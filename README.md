Using Parslet to create a creole language parser.

## According To Phind
From a question I asked Phind about the differences between French and Japanese.

"French and Japanese have several differences in their grammar. Here are some of the main differences between the two languages:

- French nouns are gendered, whereas Japanese nouns do not have gender. This means that each French noun is either masculine or feminine, which affects not only the article used with the noun but also other parts of speech such as pronouns and adjectives. Japanese does not have articles, and adjectives come before the noun they modify.
- French has fewer prepositions than English, but still more than Japanese. Prepositions are used to provide details on where something is located in time and space. French has fewer prepositions than English, but more than Japanese. Japanese has postpositions, which come after the word they modify.

It is also worth noting that French is generally considered easier to learn than Japanese for English speakers, according to [Source 1](https://doublespeakdojo.com/french-vs-japanese-which-is-easier-and-more-useful/). However, French and Japanese have different levels of global reach and usefulness, depending on individual goals and uses. French is spoken by 300 million people worldwide and is an official language of the United Nations, making it more useful for basic conversations and in more countries, businesses, and universities than Japanese. On the other hand, Japanese has a growing presence in the tech industry and is linked to Japanese culture, which gives it appeal in entertainment, sports, and arts."

## Goals
* Standardization of French and Japanese grammar into a single system.
* Keeping the language simple enough for those with basic French and Japanese skills to learn.
* Using basic French and Japanese skills to refine the training of machine learning algorithms.
* Use such machine learning models within the context of AIML.
* Use said language standardization to converse in AIML in such hybridized syntax.

## My Approach
Because Japanese itself does not come with word gender, fake genders are created for this purpose. Also some technical jargon from Japanese is combined with this form of Francais. The end goal is a language that has the global reach of French, but with the ability to converse on a relatively technical level.
