# AhusacosParser
Using Parslet to create a creole language parser.

# Goals
* Standardization of French and Japanese grammar into a single system.
* Keeping the language simple enough for those with basic French and Japanese skills to learn.
* Using basic French and Japanese skills to refine the training of machine learning algorithms.
* Use such machine learning models within the context of AIML.
* Use said language standardization to converse in AIML in such hybridized syntax.

## My Approach
Because Japanese itself does not come with word gender, fake genders are created for this purpose. Also some technical jargon from Japanese is combined with this form of Francais. The end goal is a language that has the global reach of French, but with the ability to converse on a relatively technical level.
